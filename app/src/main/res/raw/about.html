<p>This is <i>One Touch Notes</i>, a reimplementation of the great <i>Tombo</i> notes taker we once had on Windows Mobile. It allows you to organize any number of text notes in a hierarchy of folders and subfolders, yet access any note from the list with a single tap.</p>
<p><i>One Touch Notes</i> respects your privacy by storing everything exclusively on your device. It does not require network access and will never collect or transfer data outside your device.</p>
<p>If you want to thank the developer, or if you need more features, you might want to have a look at <a href="https://appgallery.huawei.com/#/app/C104625661">Memo Hub</a>.</p>
<p><i>One Touch Notes</i> is open source, and you find its repository <a href="https://github.com/cimugbit/OneTouchNotes">here</a>. The notes list is based on Bogdan Melnychuk's great <a href="https://github.com/bmelnychuk/AndroidTreeView">AndroidTreeView</a> library and displays icons using Evgeny Shishkin's elegant <a href="https://github.com/johnkil/Print">Print</a> library and a <a href="http://fontello.com/">Fontello</a> generated icon font with glyphs from the beautiful <a href="http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/">Font Awesome</a> by Dave Gandy.</p>

# One Touch Notes

Hierarchical note taker for Android

### About

One Touch Notes is a reimplementation of the great Tombo notes taker we once had on Windows Mobile.
It allows you to organize any number of text notes in a hierarchy of folders and subfolders, yet
access any note from the list with a single tap.
The notes are stored as *.txt files in a hierarchical folder structure under Android/data/org.cimugbit.onetouchnotes/files.

### Privacy Policy

One Touch Notes respects your privacy by storing everything exclusively on your device.
It does not require network access and will never collect or transfer data outside your device.
